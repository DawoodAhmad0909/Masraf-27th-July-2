# SolarConnect Pro: Solar Panel Sales & Management System
## Objectives

To digitize solar panel sales operations with real-time inventory tracking, customer management, and sales analytics for the renewable energy sector

## Overview 

The MD27thJ2_db database is a comprehensive and well-structured relational database designed to support a solar panel sales and distribution business. It captures key aspects of the supply chain, from manufacturing and inventory to sales and installation. The schema consists of six core entities:

1. Manufacturers: Stores data about solar panel producers, including certification and country of origin.

2. Solar Panels: Holds specifications such as model number, power output, efficiency, and price.

3. Customers: Includes both residential and business customers with contact and location information.

4. Installers: Contains certified installation providers with service area and certifications.

5. Inventory: Tracks solar panel stock levels by warehouse location and restock date.

6. Sales: Records detailed transactions, including quantities sold, prices, discounts, payment methods, and whether installation was included.


The database also supports advanced analytical queries to provide insights into:

1. Best-selling and most efficient solar panels

2. Customer segmentation and high-value clients

3. Sales trends over time by panel type

4. Installer performance and average system sizes

5. Inventory monitoring and warehouse valuation

``` sql
SELECT
    i.warehouse_location,
    SUM(i.quantity_in_stock * sp.price) AS total_inventory_value

ORDER BY total_installation_revenue DESC;
```
#### 12. Calculate the average system size (in watts) for each installer's projects.
``` sql
SELECT
    i.company_name,i.contact_person,
    ROUND(AVG(s.quantity * sp.power_output_watts), 2) AS avg_system_size_watts
